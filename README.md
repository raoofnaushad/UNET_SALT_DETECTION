# UNET for Salt Detection

You can download the dataset from Kaggle Deep Learning Competition - [TGS Salt Identification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge/data)

For more details about the implementation checkout the blog :
[UNET for Semantic Segmentation - Implementation from Scratch](https://raoofnaushad7.medium.com/unet-for-semantic-segmentation-implementation-from-scratch-26e043fdcffa)

For implementation:
* Install requirements.txt
* Run the notebook to generate the model. 
* Dataset can be downloaded from the link. In this notebook we only use train.zip
* Save model in the root directory
* Do the inference in notebook
